# CSGO-Server-Setup
This Git provides some configs for an extended CSGO EGG, which can be found in another Git. These files are missing from the standard CSGO server and are therefore loaded additionally.
## Gamemodes Server Config
The gamemode configs are only links to the existing files. This makes it easy if these files are updated by Valve. Some configs have additional commands that may fix some errors. These are not affected by the Valve updates.
